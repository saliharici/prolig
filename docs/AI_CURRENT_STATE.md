# PRO-LIG current state — 2026-10-11
GitHub main: 10b34f2e4090ac52164bde573f3029beca50ba13. Question media feature HEAD: 7244eec546dd280554c14a0f01defdd202e4a3c9 (7 ahead of main). Work branch: feat/permission-workflow-stabilization-20261011 from media-studio HEAD.
Antigravity audit reports 71 tests, 9 failures; lint/build PASS. Failures: YAZAR profile DB integration; EDITOR/IL project visibility; question workflow 403/409. These failures have not been independently reproduced through GitHub connector.
Source check: `getCurrentUser` selects `branchAssignments`; Prisma `User` defines relation to `UserBranchAssignment`. Audit reports relation unavailable in dev database. Investigate schema/migration deployment safely; do not remove relationship solely to hide failure. Scope builders already implement some geography and writer isolation; exact test failure stacks needed.
No feature code change, main merge, Vercel production deploy, or DB migration performed in this sprint yet.
Next: reproduce failures in isolated test DB; implement minimal authorization fixes; pass full test suite, lint and build, then obtain user acceptance before production.
