# PRO-LIG current state — 2026-10-11
GitHub main: 10b34f2e4090ac52164bde573f3029beca50ba13. Question media feature HEAD: 7244eec546dd280554c14a0f01defdd202e4a3c9 (7 ahead of main). Work branch: feat/permission-workflow-stabilization-20261011 from media-studio HEAD.
Antigravity audit reports 71 tests, 9 failures; lint/build PASS. Failures: YAZAR profile DB integration; EDITOR/IL project visibility; question workflow 403/409. These failures have not been independently reproduced through GitHub connector.
Source check: `getCurrentUser` selects `branchAssignments`; Prisma `User` defines relation to `UserBranchAssignment`. Audit reports relation unavailable in dev database. Investigate schema/migration deployment safely; do not remove relationship solely to hide failure. Scope builders already implement some geography and writer isolation; exact test failure stacks needed.
No feature code change, main merge, Vercel production deploy, or DB migration performed in this sprint yet.
Next: reproduce failures in isolated test DB; implement minimal authorization fixes; pass full test suite, lint and build, then obtain user acceptance before production.

## P0 update — 2026-10-11
- Question workflow ID parsing fixed and API regression tests added in the review branch (commits e6154fbd and 3e49217d).
- Pilot workflow fixture updated to align question grade with assigned editor grade; this has NOT been rerun against a pilot DB.
- Read-only diagnostic added: `node scripts/diagnose-branch-assignment.mjs` (commit 3d52ef8f). Requires explicit pilot-DB confirmation and queries only table/migration metadata. It does not apply migrations.
- Author DTO and scope source review shows own-profile filter is already present; exact failing integration response is still unknown. Do not loosen this access control without evidence.
- Test failures remain unverified; no claim that P0 is complete. No main merge, Vercel deploy or database mutation performed.

## P0 follow-up
- Strict ID validation now applies to question detail PATCH/archive/delete and workflow routes (commits ca090d0b and earlier e6154fbd). Malformed PATCH regression tests added (98fd4117). CI/test execution still pending.
- Development DB's UserBranchAssignment existence has NOT been verified; diagnostic is available but deliberately not executed against unknown DB.
- The local audit's nine failures remain open pending isolated integration rerun. Do not infer that ID hardening resolves those failures.

## P0 verification from local Windows run — 2026-10-11
- User ran `node scripts/p0-check.mjs`: lint/types PASS, 75/75 focused tests PASS, Vite build PASS.
- User ran `npx vitest run --exclude "tests/integration/**"`: 45 test files PASS, 405/405 tests PASS, 0 failed.
- Mocked DB Error/Tx Error stderr in question-handlers are expected injected error scenarios, not failing tests.
- Earlier two editor-grade authorization failures disappeared after user safely stashed a pre-existing local modification of `api/v1/_lib/question-access.ts`. Keep stash preserved; do not reapply without review.
- The test DB integration suite, actual `UserBranchAssignment` table, migration parity and live feature acceptance remain UNVERIFIED. No production approval given.
